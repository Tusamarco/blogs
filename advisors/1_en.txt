<h1>InnoDB Flush Method May Not Be Optimal</h1>
-----------------------------------------
<h2>Problem Description</h2>

<p>
By default, InnoDB&apos;s log buffer is written out to the log file at each transaction commit and a flush-to-disk operation is performed on the log file, which enforces ACID compliance.  In the event of a crash, if you can afford to lose a second&apos;s worth of transactions, you can achieve better performance by setting __innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit__ to either 0 or 2.  If you set the value to 2, then only an operating system crash or a power outage can erase the last second of transactions.  This can be very useful on slave servers, where the loss of a second&apos;s worth of data can be recovered from the master server if needed.
